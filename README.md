# School Portal Website (Preview Branch)

## Differences from Main
- Significant amount of work in progress
- Unstable commits
- Running on Apache Web Server

## Access
You can access this ``beta`` version of the site by adding `beta` to the URL:  
[beta.school-portal.invra.net](https://beta.school-portal.invra.net/)

## Syncing with Main Branch
We wonâ€™t be pushing out every single commit immediately. The plan for this preview branch is to serve as an early look at the upcoming website. Some features may not work as expected, be incomplete, or even get reverted. Updates will be ongoing, meaning if something is broken (like a navbar), it will be fixed, committed, and then synced.
